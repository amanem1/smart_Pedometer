# smart_Pedometer
desiging a pedometer and then filtering the output .

This pedometer project is an inspiration from a research paper : https://www.researchgate.net/publication/258046206_Accurate_Pedometer_for_Smartphones
I have learnt a lot from their work and implemented ,hence thanks to them .
the code mpu9250 library is also available in another repo of mine .
the output is to be flitered by an higher order butterworth filter , which can be implemented in any prefereble language.
